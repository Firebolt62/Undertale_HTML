      © 2015–2025 Toby Fox. All Rights Reserved.
    </h3>

    <p>
      “UNDERTALE,” including all original characters, storylines, dialogue,
      artwork, music, sound effects, and associated intellectual property, is
      the copyrighted work of Toby Fox (the “Creator”) and is protected under
      international copyright and trademark laws. All rights not expressly
      granted in this notice are reserved by the Creator. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  1. General Copyright
      Information You may not sell, redistribute, or otherwise commercially
      exploit UNDERTALE or any portion of its content without express written
      permission from the Creator. This includes, but is not limited to: Direct
      reproduction or re-uploading of the game or its assets (sprites, music,
      code, or text). Paid access to modified versions of the game. Merchandise
      or physical goods that use UNDERTALE characters, logos, or distinctive
      visual elements. The UNDERTALE logo, name, and original characters (such
      as Frisk, Sans, Papyrus, Toriel, Undyne, Alphys, Flowey, and Asgore) are
      trademarks or trademark-like elements belonging to the Creator.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Fan Works & Community Creations The Creator recognizes and deeply values the
      enthusiasm of the UNDERTALE community. Fan works are an important part of
      what makes UNDERTALE special, and the following permissions are granted,
      so long as they respect the spirit and integrity of the original work. You
      may: Create and share fan art, fan fiction, remixes, covers, and parodies
      of UNDERTALE content. Develop non-commercial fan games, mods, or alternate
      stories inspired by UNDERTALE, provided that: They are distributed for
      free, with no paywalls or monetization (including ads, paid early access,
      or premium versions). They clearly state that they are fan creations not
      affiliated with or endorsed by Toby Fox. They do not misrepresent or
      distort the original material in a way that could damage the UNDERTALE
      brand or mislead players. Share fan-made content through social media, art
      platforms, streaming, or conventions — again, non-commercially. You may
      not: Sell fan games, derivative works, or merchandise that uses UNDERTALE
      assets or characters. Use UNDERTALE music, sound effects, or sprites
      directly in commercial or promotional projects. Distribute unmodified
      copies of the game, soundtrack, or assets. If you want to use UNDERTALE
      content in a commercial capacity (e.g., licensed merchandise, paid
      adaptations, or collaborations), please contact the Creator for
      permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Streaming, Let’s Plays, and Monetized Content Monetized
      streaming or video content (e.g., Let’s Plays, reviews, or commentary
      videos on YouTube, Twitch, etc.) is explicitly allowed, as long as: The
      content provides original commentary or creative input (not just gameplay
      footage). You follow the terms of service of your chosen platform. You do
      not falsely claim affiliation with or endorsement from Toby Fox. You may
      also use UNDERTALE’s music in streams or videos as part of gameplay or
      review, but uploading isolated soundtracks or OST rips is not permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Preservation, Modding, and Technical Guidelines Modding UNDERTALE for
      personal or educational use is allowed, and the community is encouraged to
      explore creative experimentation — provided you: Do not distribute paid or
      pirated copies of the game. Do not share modified versions that include
      copyrighted assets from UNDERTALE without clear transformation or
      commentary. Properly credit the original work when referencing or adapting
      its elements. Preservationists and archivists may include UNDERTALE in
      nonprofit game preservation initiatives, provided it is not distributed
      for free download outside authorized stores.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Respect and Spirit of Use
      UNDERTALE was created with love, sincerity, and humor. Fans are encouraged
      to celebrate the game’s spirit of kindness and creativity. The Creator
      reserves the right to request removal or modification of fan works that
      are harmful, offensive, or misrepresentative of UNDERTALE’s themes or
      characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Legal Note Nothing in this notice constitutes a waiver of
      the Creator’s legal rights. This policy is intended to promote a healthy,
      respectful fan community and is subject to revision. By creating or
      sharing UNDERTALE-related fan works, you agree to abide by these terms.
      Contact: For licensing, press, or commercial inquiries, please contact the
      Creator through official UNDERTALE channels or the official website.
